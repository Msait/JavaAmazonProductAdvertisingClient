Amazon Product Services API using Java.

I'm releasing this to the wild because I found it rather difficult to get Amazon Commerce Services API working.
In theory you can use Amazon's WSDL to generate Web Service stubs. For various reasons I could not get this to work.

So here is a pretty much abandoned REST client (I moved on to other projects) that uses the generated JAXB objects 
from the WSDL and Commons HTTP Client.

To Build:

	ant build

To run the sample:

	ant run
	
Right now this client is generated with the old WSDL, see: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=1104
It also appears that search no longer works.

Maybe someone might breath some life into this.
